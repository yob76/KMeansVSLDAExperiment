# KMeans VS LDA Topic Modeling Experiment
Observations: The results from KMeans clustering and LDA topic modeling provide a clear view of how keywords in the dataset are grouped and what topics they might represent.

Starting with KMeans clustering, when we set K=2, the model broadly separates words into two groups. Cluster 0 includes words like rule, duncan, ncaa, tool, mayans, and fish, suggesting a mix of general terms and specific entities. As we increase to K=5, the clusters start to take on more specific themes, with words like duncan, mayans, fish, papers, wring, and emergency appearing together, which might indicate discussions around particular events or crises. At K=8, the words become even more specialized, with terms like bounds, prizewinning, grading, and sarah possibly pointing to topics related to achievements, evaluations, or individuals. This progression shows that as we increase the number of clusters, we get more refined groupings, helping to uncover more detailed themes in the dataset.

LDA topic modeling, on the other hand, looks at word co-occurrence to identify topics in the text. With two topics, we see a strong focus on COVID-19 statistics and the virus itself. One topic includes words like reported, deaths, number, total, states, and tests, which suggests discussions around case numbers and pandemic updates. The second topic has words like virus, spread, new, health, and coronavirus, indicating conversations about the disease and its transmission. When we expand to five topics, the themes become more distinct, with words like people, hospital, recoveries, and testing pointing to healthcare-related discussions, while indiafightscorona, trump, and India hint at political or governmental messaging. Finally, at eight topics, the results get even more specific, with clusters related to prevention such as use, prevent, and spread and statistics like cases, lakh, recoveries, tests, and new, further breaking down the datasetâ€™s key discussions.

Comparing the two methods, KMeans clustering groups words based on similarity, which helps in organizing related terms, while LDA topic modeling extracts broader themes based on word distributions. KMeans gives a more structured way to see relationships between words, whereas LDA helps us understand the underlying discussions within the dataset. Together, they provide a solid way to analyze and interpret keyword patterns in the text.
